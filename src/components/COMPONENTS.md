# 🧩 Component & Structure Guide — Computer Seekho Frontend

This markdown serves as a reference to understand the structure, purpose, and best practices of how we're organizing the **React + Vite** frontend for **Computer Seekho**.

---

## ✅ Current Component Structure

Your current component folder contains:

```

src/
├── components/
│   ├── Header.jsx & Header.css
│   ├── Hero.jsx & Hero.css
│   ├── Navbar.jsx & Navbar.css
│   └── NotificationBar.jsx & NotificationBar.css

````

Each component has:
- A `.jsx` file for logic and structure
- A `.css` file for component-specific styling

✅ **This is a correct and modular approach.** It helps with:
- **Reusability**: Components can be reused across different pages
- **Maintainability**: Styling and logic are scoped to individual files
- **Separation of concerns**: Cleaner code with clear responsibilities

---

## 📦 Components vs Pages

| Category    | Description                                                   | Example                            |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Component** | Reusable UI parts (like buttons, headers, navbars)            | `Header`, `Navbar`, `Hero`, `NotificationBar` |
| **Page**      | Full-page level UI with layout and multiple components        | `Home`, `About`, `Dashboard`       |

### ✅ Recommended Flow:
- Create **components** inside `/components` folder
- Create full **pages** inside `/pages` folder (each one representing a route)
- Use components **inside pages**
- Use pages **inside `App.jsx` via `<Routes>`**

```jsx
// Example usage in Home.jsx
import Header from '../components/Header';
import Hero from '../components/Hero';

const Home = () => (
  <>
    <Header />
    <Hero />
  </>
);
````

Then in `App.jsx`:

```jsx
<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
</Routes>
```

## 🆚 `main.jsx` vs `App.jsx`

| File       | Purpose                                                                                   |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `main.jsx` | Entry point for React DOM rendering; wraps the app with global tools like Router or Redux |
| `App.jsx`  | Root component where layout and routing of your app is defined                            |

### 🔁 In simple terms:

* **`main.jsx`** = Bootstraps the app (`ReactDOM.createRoot(...)`)
* **`App.jsx`** = Controls app layout, navigation, and page rendering

---

## 🔧 Suggested Improvements

* ✅ Keep components small, focused, and reusable.
* ✅ Group component files into folders for better scalability:

  ```
  components/
  ├── Header/
  │   ├── Header.jsx
  │   └── Header.css
  ```
* ✅ Eventually consider using **CSS Modules** or **styled-components** for scoped styling in larger projects.
* ✅ Add PropTypes or TypeScript for type safety (if needed).
* ✅ Use meaningful and consistent naming conventions for readability.

---

## 📘 Summary

* We're following **React best practices** by splitting components and styling.
* Components should be **called in pages**, and **pages are rendered via `App.jsx`**.
* `main.jsx` is the **entry point** that renders the whole app and connects to the DOM.
* This structure is **scalable**, **maintainable**, and **easy to navigate** for larger teams or long-term development.
