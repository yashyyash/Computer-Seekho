## ✅ What is **JUnit** in this code?

> **JUnit** is the testing **framework** you're using to define and run your tests.

In your file:

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
```

* These imports come from **JUnit 5 (Jupiter)**.
* The annotations like `@Test` and `@BeforeEach` mark **test methods** and **setup logic**.
* `assertEquals(...)` is a JUnit method used to check **expected vs actual** results.

🧪 Example:

```java
@Test
void testAddStudent() {
    // This is a JUnit test method
}
```

## 🧪 What is a **Mock** in this code?

> A **mock** is a **fake version of a dependency** that you control during tests, so you don't call real DBs or services.

In your file:

```java
@Mock
private PlacedStudentRepository studentRepo;

@Mock
private BatchPlacementRepository batchRepo;

@Mock
private PlacedStudentMapper mapper;
```

These are **mocked objects** created using **Mockito** (`org.mockito.*`) to simulate real behavior.

Then this part:

```java
when(batchRepo.findById(batchId.intValue())).thenReturn(Optional.of(batch));
```

Means:

> “Whenever the test calls `batchRepo.findById(...)`, return this dummy batch object instead of hitting a real DB.”

## 🧠 Why do we mock?

Imagine testing this without mocks:

* You would need a real `MySQL` DB.
* You would need real data.
* Test results would change based on database content.

Mocking solves that — you control inputs/outputs.

## 🎯 Summary of What’s What

| Code/Annotation             | Belongs to | Purpose                                                    |
| --------------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@Test`                     | JUnit      | Marks a test method.                                       |
| `@BeforeEach`               | JUnit      | Runs before each test (for setup).                         |
| `assertEquals()`            | JUnit      | Asserts expected == actual.                                |
| `@Mock`                     | Mockito    | Declares a mock object.                                    |
| `when(...).thenReturn(...)` | Mockito    | Tells the mock what to return.                             |
| `@InjectMocks`              | Mockito    | Automatically injects the mocks into the class under test. |

## 🧪 Your test flow in English:

1. Set up mocks (`studentRepo`, `batchRepo`, `mapper`).
2. Define what they should return when called.
3. Call `service.addStudent(...)`.
4. Check if the result is as expected using `assertEquals`.
5. Done — all without hitting real database or service.
